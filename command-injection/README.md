# Command Injection Attacks

> **⚡ OS Command Execution:** Comprehensive guide to discovering and exploiting command injection vulnerabilities in web applications

## Overview

**Command Injection** occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on a server that is running an application. This vulnerability is typically the result of insufficient input validation and can lead to complete system compromise.

This module covers the complete spectrum of command injection attacks, from basic detection techniques to advanced exploitation methods and defensive measures.
